# SecretSanta
A web application that allows you and your group of friends to be matched up with a partner for Kris Kringle (Sercret Santa)!

## How it works
1. List the names of all people participating in the "People Involved" field.

2. If a certain pair of people cannot receive each other, list both their names in the "Restrictions" field.
  * Example - If Bob does not want to receive Sarah as a partner, enter "Bob, Sarah" into the "Restrictions" field. Now Bob cannot receive Sarah as his secret santa!

3. If you press the "Add +" button, a new restriction field will be available for you to add more restrictions.

4. Press the "MATCH" button to generate a table of givers and takers!

## Preview
Let's break down the process of the image below:
* The names of all participants are listed in the "People Involved" input field
* Restrictions are in place
  * Alex cannot receive Rocky
  * Amber cannot receive Jesse
* If more restrictions are needed, pressing the "Add +" button adds another input field
* Restriction input fields can also be removed by pressing the "Remove -" button
* Pressing the "MATCH" button generated a table of givers and takers for secret santa!
